Why don't we use our local / personal laptops/computers to host websites and testing frameworks.
1) I have to keep my laptop up and run all the time.
2) personal laptops/computers don't have enough RAM CPU power to entertain huge requests
3) internet connections are not that good
4) security is also a very big problem when it comes to host services on local machine
for these reasons we use servers.
5) everyone can easily access them through their personal laptops

SDLC: Software Development LifeCycle
1) BAs discuss the requirements with clients and develop the SRS documents (software requirements specification)
2) This document is then shared with Architects and QA Leads
3) Architects design the software requirement documents (SRD) and QA Leads start planning the testing
4) Once the SRDs are ready developers start working and start building the application
5) This is where the deployment life cycle starts
    1) Once the application is developed on local/personal computers or laptops by developers they push the code
     to the git or any other version control system
     they request the dev ops or IT team to deploy the application to development server so that they
     are sure application still works outside their laptops
     2) QA will request dev ops or IT team to deploy it to the QA server
     3) If everything looks good all the test cases are passed QAs will deploy it to Staging server
     4) If test cases fail QA will report them to Developer and the whole cycle starts again
