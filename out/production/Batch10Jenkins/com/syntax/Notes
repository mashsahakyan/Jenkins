Why don't we use our local / personal laptops/computers to host websites and testing frameworks.
1) I have to keep my laptop up and run all the time.
2) personal laptops/computers don't have enough RAM CPU power to entertain huge requests
3) internet connections are not that good
4) security is also a very big problem when it comes to host services on local machine
for these reasons we use servers.
5) everyone can easily access them through their personal laptops

SDLC:
1) BAs discuss the requirements with clients and develop the SRS
